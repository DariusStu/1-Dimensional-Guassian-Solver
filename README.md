# 1-Dimensional-Guassian-Solver
A Gaussian distribution (bell curve) is a probability distribution, which is a continuous function. The probability that a random variable, x, will take a value between x_1 and x_2. Using a known mean (μ) and variance (σ²) the follwing Gussian Solver will comute this random variable's probability of being in the bell curve
